I have some news. Some people might be happy and some might get upset. If you're upset I completely understand and I want to apologise.

This upcoming Sunday I will be making RSM open source and free.

My reasons for this.

Sellix and Paypal. Last month sellix got seized by the FBI. The exact reason is unknown by me. Some say its because a co-founder was apart of hacking forums and some say sellix was used to sell illegal goods that they knew of but ignored. Personally I do not know. Later my Paypal account got suspended. I'm not able to process refunds or do anything on there. Paypal support has been utterly useless. No information has been provided from them either. I simply logged in one day and saw a suspension notice. All response I get from them is "After reviewing your account, it has been deemed a security risk. We reserve the right to suspend your account without notice as per our user agreement."

Easy payment alternatives are not possible in my country.

Time, energy and mental health. RSM was started back in 2016 when I first started learning programming in school. I barely played Rust and I still barley do but the way Rust servers could be set up with Oxide amazed me. It was extremely developer friendly. Back then I only had school to worry about. Now in 2025 I have a full time job as a software developer making production and QA systems which unfortunately does take a lot of my time. The little I had I tried to work on RSM but lacked any creativity to do so. I got burned out trying to mix RSM development and my job as I completely did the development and severs myself. I simply just dont have the time and energy to keep this payment model active anymore. 

I am grateful for several people that took it upon themselves to assist with supporting people.

The discord server will be opened up to everyone and the customers role will be changed to “og customer”. If you no longer wish to have the role you can message me. The verify bot will be taken offline.

Both v2 and v3 will be updated to have the license manager removed as well as the update servers. New versions will be released on github.

Again. I do apologise for those that are upset. I completely understand and I would be upset too.

This is not the end of RSM but a new open source chapter for it. I appreciate everyone’s support.
